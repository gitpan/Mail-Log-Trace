SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Log::Trace;
  
      my $tracer = Mail::Log::Trace::SUBCLASS->new({log_file => 'path/to/log'});
      $tracer->set_message_id('message_id');
      $tracer->find_message();
      my $from_address = $tracer->get_from_address();
  
      etc.

DESCRIPTION
    This is the root-level class for a mail tracer: It allows you to search
    for and find messages in maillogs. Accessors are provided for info
    common to most maillogs: Specific subclasses may have further accessors
    depending on their situation.

    Probably the two methods most commonly used (and sort of the point of
    this module) are `find_message' and `find_message_info'. Both are simply
    stubs for subclasses to implement: The first is defined to find the
    first (or first from current location...) mention of the specified
    message in the log. Depending on the log format that may or may not be
    the only mention, and there may be information missing/incomplete at
    that point.

    `find_message_info' should find *all* information about a specific
    message in the log. (Well, all information about a specific instance of
    the message: If there are multiple messages that would match the info
    provided it must find info on the first found.) That may mean searching
    through the log for other information.

    If you just need to find if the message exists, use `find_message': it
    will be faster (or at the least, the same speed. It should never be
    slower.)

USAGE
    This is a an object-orientend module, with specific methods documented
    below.

    The string coersion is overloaded to return the class name, and the file
    we are working with. Boolean currently checks to see if we were able to
    open the file. (Which is kinda silly, as we'd through an error if we
    couldn't.)

    All times are expected to be in Unix epoc-time format.

  new (constructor)

    The base constructor for the Mail::Log::Trace classes. It takes inital
    values for the following in a hash: `from_address', `to_address',
    `message_id', `log_file'. The only required value is the path to the
    logfile.

        use Mail::Log::Trace;
        my $object = Mail::Log::Trace->new({  from_address => 'from@example.com',
                                              to_address   => 'to@example.com',
                                              message_id   => 'messg.id.string',
                                              log_file     => 'path/to/log',
                                            });

  SETTERS

    set_from_address
    Sets the from address of the message we are looking for.

    set_message_id
    Sets the message_id of the message we are looking for. (Check with the
    specific parser class for what that means in a particular log format.)

    set_recieved_time
    Sets the recieved time of the message we are looking for. (The time this
    machine got the message.)

    set_sent_time
    Sets the sent time of the message we are looking for. (The time this
    machine sent the message.)

    set_relay_host
    Sets the relay host of the message we are looking for. Commonly either
    the relay we recieved it from, or the relay we sent it to. (Depending on
    the logfile.)

    set_subject
    Sets the subject of the message we are looking for.

    set_parser_class
    Sets the parser class to use when searching the log file. A subclass
    will have a 'default' parser that it will normally use: This is to allow
    easy site-specific logfile formats based on more common formats. To use
    you would subclass the default parser for the log file format of the
    base program to handle the site's specific changes.

    Takes the name of a class as a string, and will throw an exception
    (`Mail::Log::Exceptions::InvalidParameter') if that class name doesn't
    start with Mail::Log::Parse.

    set_log
    Sets the log file we are searching throuh. Takes a full or relative
    path. If it doesn't exist, or can't be read by the current user, it will
    throw an exception. (`Mail::Log::Exceptions::LogFile') Note that it does
    *not* try to open it immedeately. That will be done at first attempt to
    read from the logfile.

    set_to_address
    Sets the to address of the message we are looking for. Multiple
    addresses can be specified, they will all be added, with duplicates
    skipped. This method completely clears the array: there will be no
    addresses in the list except those given to it. Duplicates will be
    consolidated: Only one of any particular address will be in the final
    array.

    As a special case, passing `undef' to this will set the array to undef.

    add_to_address
    Adds to the list of to addresses we are looking for. It does *not*
    delete the array first.

    Duplicates will be consolidated, so that the array will only have one of
    any given address. (No matter the order they are given in.)

    remove_to_address
    Removes a single to address from the array.

  GETTERS

    get_from_address
    Gets the from address. (Either as set using the setter, or as found in
    the log.)

    get_to_address
    Gets the to address array. (Either as set using the setters, or as found
    in the log.)

    Will return a reference to an array, or 'undef' if the to address has
    not been set/found.

    get_message_id
    Gets the message_id. (Either as set using the setter, or as found in the
    log.)

    get_subject
    Gets the message subject. (Either as set using the setter, or as found
    in the log.)

    get_recieved_time
    Gets the recieved time. (Either as set using the setter, or as found in
    the log.)

    get_sent_time
    Gets the sent time. (Either as set using the setter, or as found in the
    log.)

    get_relay_host
    Gets the relay host. (Either as set using the setter, or as found in the
    log.)

    get_log
    Returns the path to the logfile we are reading.

    get_connect_time
    Returns the time the remote host connected to this host to send the
    message.

    get_disconnect_time
    Returns the time the remote host disconnected from this host after
    sending the message.

    get_delay
    Returns the total delay in this stage in processing the message.

    get_all_info
    Returns message info as returned from the parser, for more
    direct/complete access.

    (It's probably a good idea to avoid using this, but it is useful and
    arguably needed under certain circumstances.)

  Utility subroutines

    clear_message_info
    Clears *all* known information on the current message, but not on the
    log.

    Use to start searching for a new message.

    find_message
    Finds the first/next occurance of a message in the log. Can be passed
    any of the above information in a hash format.

    Default is to search *forward* in the log: If you have already done a
    search, this will start searching where the previous search ended. To
    start over at the beginning of the logfile, set `from_start' as true in
    the parameter hash.

    This method needs to be overridden by the subclass: by default it will
    throw an `Mail::Log::Exceptions::Unimplemented' error.

    find_message_info
    Finds as much information as possible about a specific occurance of a
    message in the logfile. Acts much the same as find_message, other than
    the fact that once it finds a message it will do any searching necarry
    to find all information on that message connection.

    (Also needs to be implemented by subclasses.)

BUGS
    None known at the moment...

REQUIRES
    Scalar::Util, Mail::Log::Exceptions.

    Some subclass, and probably a Mail::Log::Parse class to be useful.
